Version 0.14 - fix
* Login is fixed... again

Version 0.14
* Login system has been updated and fixed! I had to learn some Angular JS to figure this one out!
* Added a delay between requests. Before it was perfect. It's a bit slower now, but it's more human-like
* Fixed farming. Some people were banned by other bots because they're unstable! Mine will stop the second anything goes wrong.
* Constructing buildings now comes before culture checking for culture events.
* Culture now checks to see if it can even be done before attempting.
* Constructing buildings now checks to see if there's any reason to load the senate (there's a random chance of force updating)
* Constructing barrack units now checks to see if there's any reason to load the barracks (there's a random chance of force updating)
* Constructing dock units now checks to see if there's any reason to load the docks (there's a random chance of force updating)
* You can now pause the bot!

Version 0.13
* New login system broke the current one. I'll have to figure it out later. Finals start this week!
* Updating the logging system so that it's centralized. Timestamps everywhere! (also easily to add to GUI later on)
* Queue will now remember your previously selected town

Version 0.12
* Now removes cities that are no longer in your possession
* Added support for adding GRC directly from their website!
* Added support for reading converted reports in alliance forums by default.
