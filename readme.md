#### Notice
This is the source code and release for GrepolisBot. This is the ONLY location that I plan on hosting the source and releasing the bot. ALL features will be free. This bot is based on [Grepolis 2 Bot](https://github.com/josdemmers/Grepolis2Bot/), but it's written in Java. Feel free to contribute. If you would like to donate, you can do so here: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=78NSNHLQ38GRW

# Setup

1. Update your java [here](https://java.com/en/download/). There is a HUGE difference between earlier versions of java for the browser.
2. Extract the zip file above.
4. Enter in your username, password, and world.
5. Click the browser tab and then login to Grepolis. The bot shows as the most recent version of chrome. You should use chrome as your main browser when not botting to decrease your risk of being banned.
6. Start the bot when you're ready. I suggest waiting for the bot to go through all your towns first before changing settings.
